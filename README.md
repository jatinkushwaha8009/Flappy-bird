# Flappy Bird Game in Python

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game. Developed using the Pygame library, this project demonstrates basic game development principles, including handling game mechanics, collision detection, and scoring.

## Features

- **Simple Gameplay**: Control the bird by tapping the space bar or clicking to make it flap and navigate through pipes.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect and respond to collisions with pipes and the ground.
- **Scoring System**: Keep track of the player's score based on the number of pipes successfully passed.
- **Graphics and Sound**: Includes basic graphics and sound effects for a complete gaming experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for development.
- **Pygame**: The library used for creating the gameâ€™s graphical interface and handling game mechanics.
